        This article focuses on many of the dangers surrounding artificial intelligence as experts in the College of Engineering discuss how this technology can impact individuals, the economy, and the environment. Experts warn that AI can be biased, as it often learns from incomplete or flawed data. Furthermore, Professor Eugenia Rho argues that Artificial Intelligence can begin to influence an individualâ€™s decisions without them even realizing it. AI-powered tools, like chatbots, can make people too dependent on technology, in turn weakening their ability to think critically and connect with others. Another big concern discussed is job loss; because AI is automating tasks, it could leave many people unemployed. Professors Walid Saad and Ali Shojaei also argue its environmental cost, as AI requires massive amounts of energy and further increases its carbon footprint. Lastly, Department Head Ella Atkins warns that AI can spread false information, making it harder to tell what is real and what is fake.

        This article discusses several major concerns regarding artificial intelligence, including bias, job loss, regulatory issues, cyber threats, and even terrorism. AI bias can be very common due to how it learns from specific data, and if the data is incorrect or contains biases, the AI can produce unfair outcomes, which can even affect areas in hiring and law enforcement. Another big concern discussed in the article is job loss. Because AI automates tasks, many traditional jobs that required human workers could be lost, forcing workers to retrain for different roles and jobs. Regulation challenges also pose a risk, as artificial intelligence has been developing faster than governments can create laws to control it. Additionally, the article mentions the risk of AI accelerated hacking, making cyberattacks more dangerous and difficult to prevent.
