        The Tableau article on the history of artificial intelligence traces its evolution from ancient concepts to modern advancements. Early concepts of AI date back to ancient times with mechanical devices known as automatons. In the early 20th century, the idea of creating artificial brains gained traction, leading to the coining of the term "robot" in 1921. The 1950s marked the formal birth of artificial intelligence as a scientific field, focusing on developing machines capable of mimicking human intelligence. Decades following saw periods of rapid progress, known as “AI booms,” and times of slowdown, referred to as “AI winters.” Advancements in AI agents and the tracking of artificial general intelligence (AGI) have been significant milestones. Today, artificial intelligence is essential to multiple aspects of daily life, and understanding its historical context is essential for anticipating future developments.

        The IBM article provides an overview of artificial intelligence development, describing its evolution from early concepts to modern advancements. IBM highlights key milestones, including the creation of the first artificial neural network in 1951, the coining of the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955, and the development of important AI programs like ELIZA and MYCIN. The article also discusses the periods known as "AI winters," characterized by reduced funding and interest due to unmet expectations. In recent years, breakthroughs like IBM's “Deep Blue” defeating a world chess champion, the emergence of deep learning techniques, and the development of large language models like GPT-3 have significantly advanced the field. These developments have led to AI's integration into various aspects of daily life, from virtual assistants to complex problem solving applications. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding AI's history to appreciate its current capabilities and future potential.
